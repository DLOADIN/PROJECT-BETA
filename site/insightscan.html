    <h2>Data coverage:</h2>
    <p>The data encompasses B2C enterprises. Figures are based on the total consumer spending on food, which comprises all
    private household spending on food that is meant for at-home consumption (out-of-home consumption is not accounted for)
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Modeling Approach:</h2>
    <p>Market sizes are determined through a top-down approach, building on specific predefined factors for each market segment.
As a basis for evaluating markets, we use resources from the Statista platform as well as in-house market research, national
statistical offices, international institutions, trade associations, companies, the trade press, and the experience of our analysts.
In addition, we use relevant key market indicators and data from country-specific associations, such as GDP, consumer
spending, and consumer price index. This data helps us estimate the market size for each country individually.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Forecasts:</h2>
    <p>In our forecasts, we apply diverse forecasting techniques. The selection of forecasting techniques is based on the behavior of
the relevant market. For example, the exponential trend smoothing is well suited for forecasting the Food market with a
projected steady growth. The main drivers are GDP per capita and consumer spending per capita.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Additional Notes:</h2>
    <p>The data is modeled using current exchange rates. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war are
considered at a country-specific level. The market is updated twice a year.
